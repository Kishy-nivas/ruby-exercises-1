# This is how we require the print-triangle.rb file in the current folder.
# We can now use the "print_triangle" and "print_line" methods we defined
# there â€” as if we defined them here!

  # Suggestion: you can call print_triangle to print out the first, "upward" half of the pyramid
  # You'll have to write code to print out the second, "downward" half of the pyramid.
