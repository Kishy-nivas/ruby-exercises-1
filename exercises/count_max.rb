# Method name: count_max
# Inputs:      A list of numbers
# Returns:     The number of times the largest number in the list
#              appears in the list
# Prints:      Nothing
#
# For example,
#   count_max([10, 1,2,10,10]) == 3
# because "10" is the largest number in the list and it occurs 3 times

# This is how we require the max.rb and count_in_list.rb files in the current folder.
# We can now use the "max" and "count_in_list" methods we defined there â€” justs
# as if we had defined them here!

require_relative './max'
require_relative './count_in_list'

def count_max(list)
  # You can write this using nothing more than the max and count_in_list
  # methods that you've already written.  You do not HAVE to, but it's worth
  # trying. The "requite_relative" statements above make them available to us, here.
  #
  # But remember: inelegant, working code is better than elegant, unfinished code.
  
  # largest_num = max(list) # Realized I could just pass result of max in the paramater list for count_in_list
  count_in_list(list, max(list)) # Return result of count_in_list passing in list and result of max method.
